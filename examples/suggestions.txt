That's great! Having a diverse set of problems is crucial for thoroughly testing an evolutionary algorithm library. Here are some more good examples that cover different aspects and complexities:

**Optimization Problems:**

* **Knapsack Problem:**
    * **Description:** Given a set of items, each with a weight and a value, determine the subset of items that can fit into a knapsack with a given weight capacity and maximizes the total value.
    * **Why it's good:** It's a classic combinatorial optimization problem with a clear objective function and constraints. It can be implemented with binary representations for item selection.
    * **Considerations:** You can vary the number of items and the knapsack capacity to test scalability.

* **Bin Packing Problem:**
    * **Description:** Given a set of items of different sizes, pack them into a minimum number of bins, each with a fixed capacity.
    * **Why it's good:** Another classic optimization problem with various real-world applications. It requires finding efficient packing arrangements.
    * **Considerations:** The representation of solutions can be more complex than the knapsack problem.

* **Function Optimization:**
    * **Description:** Find the input values to a given mathematical function that result in the minimum or maximum output value.
    * **Why it's good:** Allows you to test the algorithm's ability to navigate continuous search spaces. You can use various benchmark functions like Rosenbrock, Rastrigin, Schwefel, etc., with different dimensionality.
    * **Considerations:** Requires representing solutions as real-valued vectors.

* **Feature Selection:**
    * **Description:** Given a dataset with many features, select a subset of the most relevant features for a machine learning task (e.g., classification or regression) to improve performance or reduce complexity.
    * **Why it's good:** A practical problem in machine learning. The fitness function would typically involve evaluating the performance of a model trained on the selected features.
    * **Considerations:** The fitness evaluation can be computationally expensive as it involves training and evaluating a machine learning model.

**Scheduling Problems:**

* **Job Shop Scheduling Problem:**
    * **Description:** Schedule a set of jobs on a set of machines, where each job consists of a sequence of operations, and each operation must be performed on a specific machine for a given duration. The goal is to minimize the makespan (total time to complete all jobs).
    * **Why it's good:** A complex combinatorial optimization problem with constraints on machine usage and operation order.
    * **Considerations:** Solution representation and genetic operators can be challenging to design effectively.

* **Resource-Constrained Project Scheduling Problem (RCPSP):**
    * **Description:** Schedule a set of activities with dependencies and resource requirements to minimize the project duration, subject to resource availability constraints.
    * **Why it's good:** A more generalized scheduling problem than job shop, involving precedence constraints and multiple resource types.
    * **Considerations:** Similar to job shop, representation and operators require careful design.

**Design and Configuration Problems:**

* **Parameter Optimization for Algorithms:**
    * **Description:** Use your evolutionary algorithm library to find the optimal hyperparameters for another algorithm (e.g., a machine learning algorithm or even itself!).
    * **Why it's good:** A meta-optimization problem that can demonstrate the flexibility of your library.
    * **Considerations:** The search space can be continuous or discrete, and the fitness function involves running and evaluating the target algorithm with different parameter settings.

* **Circuit Design (Simple Example):**
    * **Description:** Design a simple digital circuit (e.g., a logic gate or a small adder) by evolving the connections between components to satisfy a given truth table.
    * **Why it's good:** Introduces a design aspect where the solution is a structure rather than just a sequence or set.
    * **Considerations:** Requires a way to represent the circuit structure and evaluate its functionality.

**Tips for Testing:**

* **Vary Problem Size:** Test your algorithm with small, medium, and large instances of each problem to assess its scalability.
* **Different Fitness Functions:** Experiment with different ways to define the fitness function for the same problem to see how it affects the algorithm's performance.
* **Compare with Known Optima:** For problems with known optimal solutions (or good heuristics), compare the results of your evolutionary algorithm.
* **Analyze Performance Metrics:** Track metrics like best fitness over generations, convergence speed, and solution diversity.
* **Test Different Evolutionary Operators:** Ensure your library allows for different selection, crossover, and mutation operators and test their effectiveness on various problems.
* **Parameter Tuning:** Use some of these problems to test your library's ability to handle parameter tuning of the evolutionary algorithm itself (e.g., population size, mutation rate).

By implementing and testing your library on this diverse set of problems, you'll gain a much better understanding of its strengths, weaknesses, and areas for improvement. Good luck!
