MNIST data set:

- try test network with 100 repeats.
- Use categorical cross-entropy loss:
  loss_per_sample = -np.sum(y_true * np.log(y_pred_clipped), axis=1)
  mean_loss = np.mean(loss_per_sample)

  Binary Cross-Entropy (for two classes)

- neural_net_base: always check if mutation was successful. If not choose another one.
