- Topology Change
  - Split Node: You could split an existing node into two, with the incoming connections of the
    original node being randomly distributed (or duplicated with slight weight variations) to the
    two new nodes. The new nodes would then have their own outgoing connections (potentially
    inherited from the original node). This can allow for more complex feature extraction.


MNIST data set:

- try test network with 100 repeats.
- Use categorical cross-entropy loss:
  loss_per_sample = -np.sum(y_true * np.log(y_pred_clipped), axis=1)
  mean_loss = np.mean(loss_per_sample)

  Binary Cross-Entropy (for two classes)
