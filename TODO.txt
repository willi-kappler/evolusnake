TODO:

- add quit notification to parasnake.
- Compare fitness of previous best one, if better than 10% debug or info.
- Check if port is in already in use, if so choose the next port in list.

DONE:

# population kind 4: global fitness
# method for returning population based on config kind.
# early exit at iteration 0: use sleep() for one second to avoid spamming the server.
# keep track of mutation operation: statistics on the most used operation for the best individual.
# use mutation_opertation_max and set the mutation operation when the population calls the individual es_mutate() method.
# test cases for population kind 4.
# test cases for population kind 5.
# test cases for population kind 6.
# test cases for population kind 7.
# test cases for new methods in population.
# add population 8: limit depends on best individual fitness * factor
# add population 9: clone from best and mutate, fitness must be unique
# population 10: clone from best, fitness can exist multiple times.
# population 11: use sine wave for fitness limit.
# Keep track of which population had the most best individuals.
# Put fitness into JSON, get fitness from JSON.
